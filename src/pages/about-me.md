I started developing my first commercial projects as a web developer in 2020, though I've been passionate about technology since childhood. My journey began at age 6 when I discovered computers and the internet, sparking a lifelong fascination with technology.

## My Beginnings in Programming 🖥️

In 2021, I entered senior high school and pursued a STEM strand. My first major project was creating a website using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This experience taught me the complexity of web development and gradually led me to fall in love with web design and development, focusing on **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Creating Impact with Technology 🌍

In 2022, I helped create **LND Credly**, a community for ministry members focused on organizing events, workshops, and mentoring to strengthen the local technology ecosystem.

## Recent Projects 🚀

In 2025, I am currently developing **LargaNa!**, a trip estimator app that helps users plan their trips by estimating the time of their journey so they will not be late again.

## About Me Today ☕

Currently in 2025, I'm a **Computer Science Student** in my 3rd year, collaborating with classmates on various projects. I embrace the maker spirit: learning, experimenting, and creating new things. I'm passionate about music, matcha, and bringing innovative ideas to life.

I'm **Francis Neil M. Mistica**, and I thank you for reading this.
